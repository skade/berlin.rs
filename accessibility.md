Berlin.rs wants to be an inclusive community and cares about accessibility. For that reason, we check our venues for:

* wheelchair accessibility
* accessible toilets
* noise
* retreat spots for people with sensory issues

Comfort and guide animals are welcome.

If you have an accessibility need to be covered at our events, please [send us an email](mailto:flo@andersground.net). We'll do our best to help.
