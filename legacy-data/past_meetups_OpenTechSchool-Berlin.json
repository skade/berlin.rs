    "description": "<p>We are very happy to announce the organisation of the very first RustBridge here in Berlin: a hands-on workshop to learn Rust. As part of RustFest taking place that weekend, the OpenTechSchool Berlin is organising a beta-run of a beginners workshop to learn Rust on Sunday, September 18th, 2016 at Co-Up.</p> <p><b> What is<a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/\"> Rust</a> ? </b></p> <p>Rust is a new, safe systems programming language developed primarily by Mozilla. Systems programming? You might have heard of C/C++ as languages to built low-level and super fast programs with. Rust plays in the same league but as a very young language is from the ground up designed to deal with concurrent multi-processing environments (like multi-core CPUs). Further more it provides new mechanism to improve \"safety\" of your programs memory, the primary reason why C/C++ are considered hard and that high level languages like Python, Ruby and Javascript handle for you with a high performance penalty.</p> <p>Or to say it with the claim from <a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/\">rust-lang.org</a>:<i> \"Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.\"</i></p> <p><b>What is RustBridge? </b></p> <p>In the traditions of <a href=\"http://railsbridge.org/\">RailsBridge</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-community/rustbridge\">RustBridge</a> is a community initiative to develop a workshop to teach absolute beginners about programming using Rust. This will be its very first trial workshop. Therefore the material might be a little rough and not super polished yet: feedback is very welcome!</p> <p>We are currently aiming for two distinct workshops to work through on your own. While one aims to be suitable for beginners the other is already a bit more challenging and will bring you deeper into more advanced rust topics. Though the format eventually aims to be suitable for total beginners, for this edition we require that you have some essential programming experience. It's still a beta!</p> <p>This event is organised in collaboration and as part of RustFest – a  community conference dedicated to the Rust Programming language taking place on the very same weekend of September 17th/18th. You can learn more (and get ticket) at <a href=\"http://www.rustfest.eu\">RustFest.EU</a>.</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://discourse.opentechschool.org/t/rustbridge-workshop-sept-18th-berlin-together-with-rustfest/1849\">All Requirements, details and sign up over on the community forum</a></b>.</p>",
