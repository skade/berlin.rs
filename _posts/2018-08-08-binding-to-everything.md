It is time for another Rust meetup in Berlin!

This time we have a mini-conference around one topic: _bindgen_.

The meetup will happen on Wednesday, August 8th, 2018 19:00

We will meet in the beautiful Mozilla Berlin Office for a fresh round of talks, drinks, food and chatter about everyone’s favorite programming language.

We’re looking forward to see you there!
