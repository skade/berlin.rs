Our first "Rust and Tell" event: We introduce the concept and have our first speakers present their projects.

The main idea is to look behind the human mind of a crate, project or learning Rust in general. Explain how you got started, how you managed to implement Rust on the server etc etc. Present your project, how you struggled and/or succeeded and answer some questions afterwards.

We will have 5 slots, with 20 minutes each. You decide on how you want to fill this time. If you want to use less, also feel free to do so.

Since it's the first time we are doing this, we will have fixed speakers. So if you are working on anything related Rust, reach out to an organiser or via the comments so we can put you in a slot.

It is open to EVERYONE. From absolut beginner to experienced Rust programmers.
