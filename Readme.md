# Berlin.rs 

This is the [rust-meetup-template](http://github.com/rust-community/rust-meetup-template)-based website for http://berlin.rs.

## Local development

Sometimes you want to test or modify things locally. Luckily, this is pretty easy, you just have to do the following:

- Clone or download the repository
- Make sure you have Ruby 2.2.5 or above installed
- Run `bundle install` in the directory where you cloned the project (if you don't have Bundler installed, install it using `gem install bundler`)
- Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to get a local preview of your site. It auto-updates every time you edit something
- If you want LiveReload functionality, run `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`
